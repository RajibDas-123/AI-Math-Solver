Calculate $f(100)$.\n","\n","Solution: We will solve this problem by finding a pattern in the function $f(n)$ and then applying that pattern to find $f(100)$.\n","\n","First, let's find $f(1)$ using the second equation: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. We know that $f(2)$ is a positive integer, so $2f(1) + 1$ must be a positive integer. The smallest positive integer value for $f(1)$ that satisfies this equation is $f(1) = 1$.\n","\n","Now, we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$. Substituting $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(1)) = 8 \\cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. So, $f(1) = 1$ indeed satisfies both equations.\n","\n","Now we can find $f(2)$ using the second equation: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 3$. Then, we can find $f(3)$ using the second equation: $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. We know that $f(6) = f(f(f(2))) = f(f(3)) = f(3)$. So, $f(3)$ also satisfies the first equation: $f(f(f(3))) = f(f(3)) = f(3) = 8 \\cdot 3 - 7 = 17$.\n","\n","Continuing this process, we can find $f(4)$, $f(5)$, and so on. After a few steps, we notice a pattern: $f(n) = 2n - 1$.\n","\n","To verify this pattern, we can substitute $f(n) = 2n - 1$ into both equations:\n","\n","1. $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$: When $f(n) = 2n - 1$, $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$.\n","2. $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$: When $f(n) = 2n - 1$, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 2 + 1 = 2n + 1$.\n","\n","So, the pattern $f(n) = 2n - 1$ indeed satisfies both equations and is the solution to the problem.\n","\n","Finally, we can calculate $f(100)$ using the pattern: $f(100) = 2 \\cdot 100 - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199$.\n","\n","Therefore, $f(100) = 199$.\n","\n","The answer is: $199$.\n","CPU times: user 56.1 s, sys: 511 ms, total: 56.6 s\n","Wall time: 56.6 s\n"]}],"source":["%%time\n","\n","# prompt = \"Problem Statement: A community is building a metal fence.
