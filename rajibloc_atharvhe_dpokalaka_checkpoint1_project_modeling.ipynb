Alice obviously wins if there is one coin. She will just take it and win. If there are 2 remaining, then Alice will take one and then Bob will take one, so Bob wins. If there are $3$ , Alice will take $1$ , Bob will take one, and Alice will take the final one. If there are $4$ , Alice will just remove all $4$ at once. If there are $5$ , no matter what Alice does, Bob can take the final coins in one try. Notice that Alice wins if there are $1$ , $3$ , or $4$ coins left. Bob wins if there are $2$ or $5$ coins left. After some thought, you may realize that there is a strategy for Bob. If there is n is a multiple of $5$ , then Bob will win. The reason for this is the following: Let's say there are a multiple of $5$ coins remaining in the stack. If Alice takes $1$ , Bob will take $4$ , and there will still be a multiple of $5$ . If Alice takes $4$ , Bob will take $1$ , and there will still be a multiple of $5$ . This process will continue until you get $0$ coins left. For example, let's say there are $205$ coins. No matter what Alice does, Bob can simply just do the complement. After each of them make a turn, there will always be a multiple of $5$ left. This will continue until there are $5$ coins left, and Bob will end up winning. After some more experimentation, you'll realize that any number that is congruent to $2$ mod $5$ will also work. This is because Bob can do the same strategy, and when there are $2$ coins left, Alice is forced to take $1$ and Bob takes the final coin. For example, let's say there are $72$ coins. If Alice takes $1$ , Bob will take $4$ . If Alice takes $4$ , Bob will take $1$ . So after they each make a turn, the number will always be equal to $2$ mod $5$ . Eventually, there will be only $2$ coins remaining, and we've established that Alice will simply take $1$ and Bob will take the final coin. So we have to find the number of numbers less than or equal to $2024$ that are either congruent to $0$ mod $5$ or $2$ mod $5$ . There are $404$ numbers in the first category: $5, 10, 15, \\\\dots, 2020$ . For the second category, there are $405$ numbers. $2, 7, 12, 17, \\\\dots, 2022$ . So the answer is $404 + 405 = \\\\boxed{809}$\",\n","       \"This is a conditional probability problem. Bayes' Theorem states that  Let us calculate the probability of winning a prize. We do this through casework: how many of Jen's drawn numbers match the lottery's drawn numbers? To win a prize, Jen must draw at least $2$ numbers identical to the lottery. Thus, our cases are drawing $2$ , $3$ , or $4$ numbers identical. Let us first calculate the number of ways to draw exactly $2$ identical numbers to the lottery. Let Jen choose the numbers $a$ , $b$ , $c$ , and $d$ ; we have $\\\\dbinom42$ ways to choose which $2$ of these $4$ numbers are identical to the lottery. We have now determined $2$ of the $4$ numbers drawn in the lottery; since the other $2$ numbers Jen chose can not be chosen by the lottery, the lottery now has $10-2-2=6$ numbers to choose the last $2$ numbers from. Thus, this case is $\\\\dbinom62$ , so this case yields $\\\\dbinom42\\\\dbinom62=6\\\\cdot15=90$ possibilities. Next, let us calculate the number of ways to draw exactly $3$ identical numbers to the lottery. Again, let Jen choose $a$ , $b$ , $c$ , and $d$ . This time, we have $\\\\dbinom43$ ways to choose the identical numbers and again $6$ numbers left for the lottery to choose from; however, since $3$ of the lottery's numbers have already been determined, the lottery only needs to choose $1$ more number, so this is $\\\\dbinom61$ . This case yields $\\\\dbinom43\\\\dbinom61=4\\\\cdot6=24$ . Finally, let us calculate the number of ways to all $4$ numbers matching. There is actually just one way for this to happen. In total, we have $90+24+1=115$ ways to win a prize. The lottery has $\\\\dbinom{10}4=210$ possible combinations to draw, so the probability of winning a prize is $\\\\dfrac{115}{210}$ . There is actually no need to simplify it or even evaluate $\\\\dbinom{10}4$ or actually even know that it has to be $\\\\dbinom{10}4$ ; it suffices to call it $a$ or some other variable, as it will cancel out later. However, let us just go through with this. The probability of winning a prize is $\\\\dfrac{115}{210}$ . Note that the probability of winning a grand prize is just matching all $4$ numbers, which we already calculated to have $1$ possibility and thus have probability $\\\\dfrac1{210}$ . Thus, our answer is $\\\\dfrac{\\\\frac1{210}}{\\\\frac{115}{210}}=\\\\dfrac1{115}$ . Therefore, our answer is $1+115=\\\\boxed{116}$ .\",\n","       ...,\n","       'Let $q$ and $r$ be the remainder when $x$ is divided by 19, so $x = 19q + r,$ where $0 \\\\le r \\\\le 18.$  Then\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n\\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor - 19 \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{x}{19} \\\\right\\\\rfloor &= 19q + r - 19 \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{19q + r}{19} \\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\\\\\\\n&= 19q + r - 19 \\\\left\\\\lfloor q + \\\\frac{r}{19} \\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\\\\\\\n&= 19q + r - 19q \\\\\\\\\\n&= r.\\n\\\\end{align*}Thus, when $x$ is divided by 19, the remainder is 9.
