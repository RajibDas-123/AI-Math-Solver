However, the problem can be answered without programming. The number 12 is the maximum number of yellow numbers because if we try to add more yellow numbers, the sum of any two yellow numbers would exceed the maximum possible blue number (999). Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 12. Here is a simple proof:\n","\n","Let's say we have 13 yellow numbers. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one pair of yellow numbers that differ by a multiple of 111 (since we have 111, 222, ..., 999, a total of 9 possible differences modulo 111). Let's call this pair $a$ and $b$, where $a-b = 111k$ for some integer $k$. \n","\n","Now, consider the sum of any other yellow number $c$ and $a$ (or $b$). Without loss of generality, let's consider $a+c$. If $a+c$ is yellow, then by our condition, $b+(a+c)$ (which is the same as $(b+a)+c$) must also be blue. However, $b+a = a+b - 111k = 2a - 111k = 2b + 111k$, which means $b+(a+c)$ is equal to $(b+a)+c$, but is also equal to $a+b+c - 111k + c = 2c + (a+b) - 111k = 2c + (2a - 111k) - 111k = 2c + 2a - 2*111k = 2(a+c) - 2*111k$. This means that $b+(a+c)$ is a multiple of 111 smaller than $2(a+c)$, and thus cannot be a yellow number, as it is smaller than $a+c$. This is a contradiction, as we assumed that $a+c$ is yellow. Therefore, we cannot have more than 12 yellow numbers.\n","\n","By trying to add 13 yellow numbers, we found a contradiction, so the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 12. This problem highlights the power of the Pigeonhole Principle, a simple counting argument that can be used to solve complex problems. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In this case, the yellow numbers are the pigeons and the possible sums of two yellow numbers are the pigeonholes. By trying to add 13 yellow numbers, we forced at least one of these pigeonholes to contain more than one pigeon (the pair of yellow numbers that differ by a multiple of 111), leading to a contradiction. Thus, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 12. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$.\n","\n","Note: This problem is based on Ramsey theory, a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of order in large collections of items. In this case, the Ramsey number $R(3,3)$ is 17, which means that in a set of 17 items, either a subset of 3 items will have a property P (in this case, form a blue number) or a subset of 3 items will have the same property Q (in this case, form a yellow number). However, this problem asks specifically for the maximum number of yellow numbers without exceeding the condition that the sum of any two yellow numbers is a blue number.

Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, and $f(f(1))$ is equal to some value, let's call it $x$, we have $f(x) = 1$. From the second equation, we can substitute $x = 2f(1) + 1$, so we get $f(2f(1) + 1) = 1$.
