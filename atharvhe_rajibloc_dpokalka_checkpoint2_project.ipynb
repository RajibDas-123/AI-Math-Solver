When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\nSolution: Let's break down the problem into smaller steps.\n\nStep 1: Convert the time in minutes for the given times.\nThe walk takes 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the walk takes 4*60 = 240 minutes. Adding the $t$ minutes in the coffee shop, the total time is $240+t$ minutes.\nSimilarly, the walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. This is equal to 2*60 + 24 = 144 minutes. Adding the $t$ minutes in the coffee shop, the total time is $144+t$ minutes.\n\nStep 2: Set up the equations based on the total distances and speeds.\nThe distance of the walk is 9 kilometers. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 240 minutes. This gives us the equation $9 = s*\\frac{240}{60}$, or $9 = 4s$.\nWhen she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 144 minutes. This gives us the equation $9 = (s+2)*\\frac{144}{60}$, or $9 = 2.4(s+2)$.\n\nStep 3: Solve the equations to find the value of $s$.\nFrom the equation $9 = 4s$, we can solve for $s$ to get $s = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25$.\nSubstituting $s = 2.25$ into the equation $9 = 2.4(s+2)$, we get $9 = 2.4(2.25+2) = 2.4*4.25 = 10.2$. This is not true, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations.\n\nLet's go back and re-evaluate our steps.\n\nStep 1: Convert the time in minutes for the given times.\nThe walk takes 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the walk takes 4*60 = 240 minutes. Adding the $t$ minutes in the coffee shop, the total time is $240+t$ minutes.\nSimilarly, the walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. This is equal to 2*60 + 24 = 144 minutes. Adding the $t$ minutes in the coffee shop, the total time is $144+t$ minutes.\n\nStep 2: Set up the equations based on the total distances and speeds.\nThe distance of the walk is 9 kilometers. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 240 minutes. This gives us the equation $9 = s*\\frac{240}{60}$, or $9 = 4s$. This is correct.\nWhen she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 144 minutes. This gives us the equation $9 = (s+2)*\\frac{144}{60}$, or $9 = 2.4(s+2)$. This is also correct.\n\nStep 3: Solve the equations to find the value of $s$.\nFrom the equation $9 = 4s$, we can solve for $s$ to get $s = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25$. This is correct.\nSubstituting $s = 2.25$ into the equation $9 = 2.4(s+2)$, we get $9 = 2.4(2.25+2) = 2.4*4.25 = 10.2$. This is true, so our calculations are correct.\n\nStep 4: Find the value of $s+\\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstituting $s = 2.25$ into $s+\\frac{1}{2}$, we get $2.25+\\frac{1}{2} = 2.25+0.5 = 2.75$.\n\nStep 5: Find the time it takes for the walk at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour.\nThe time it takes for the walk at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour is $\\frac{9}{2.75} = \\frac{9*2}{5.5*2} = \\frac{18}{11}$ hours. Converting this to minutes, we get $\\frac{18}{11}*60 = \\frac{1080}{11} \\approx 98.18$ minutes.\n\nStep 6: Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\nSince we know that the walk takes approximately 98.18 minutes and including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is $98.18+t$ minutes.\nHowever, we are not given the value of $t$, so we cannot determine the exact value of $98.18+t$.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\nThe value of $s$ is 2.25, and the value of $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ is 2.75.\nCPU times: user 2min 17s, sys: 361 ms, total: 2min 18s\nWall time: 2min 18s\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def generate_prompt(data_point, template):\n    prompt = template + \"\\n\\nProblem: \" + df[\"problem\"].values[0] + \" \".strip()\n    return prompt\n\n\ndef generate_and_tokenize_prompt(data_point):\n    full_prompt = generate_prompt(data_point, template)\n    tokenized_full_prompt = tokenizer(full_prompt, padding=True, truncation=True)\n    return tokenized_full_prompt\n\ndata = data.shuffle().map(generate_and_tokenize_prompt)","metadata":{"id":"lm60o2_No7Jz","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-07T03:42:07.832554Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-07T03:42:07.832819Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-07T03:42:08.137501Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-07T03:42:07.832795Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-07T03:42:08.136813Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"  0%|          | 0/100 [00:00<?, ?ex/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"b6e0a3b05f004771b972b20dcdcf37c6"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-07T03:42:08.138541Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-07T03:42:08.138812Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-07T03:42:08.144341Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-07T03:42:08.138788Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-07T03:42:08.143422Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[{"execution_count":26,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"Dataset({\n    features: ['problem', 'solution', 'answer', '__index_level_0__', 'input_ids', 'attention_mask'],\n    num_rows: 100\n})"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data['problem'][0])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-07T03:42:08.145594Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-07T03:42:08.146060Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-07T03:42:08.152688Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-07T03:42:08.146028Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-07T03:42:08.151808Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"The greatest common divisor of two positive integers is $(x+5)$ and their least common multiple is $x(x+5)$, where $x$ is a positive integer.

The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?\n\nSolution: The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points, so we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ be $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively. Then by the quadratic formula, we have $x_{1,2} = \\frac{2k \\pm \\sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{4k - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}$.\n\nThe distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. We have\n\\begin{align*}\n6 &= \\left| \\left(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{4k - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\\right) - \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{4k - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\\right) \\right| \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sqrt{4k - 4kl + 16k}}{k}.\n\\end{align*}\nSimplifying, we get $36k^2 = 4k - 4kl + 16k$, or $36k^2 = 20k - 4kl$. Rearranging terms, we have $4kl = 20k - 36k^2 = 4k(5 - 9k)$. Since $k, l > 0$, we can divide both sides by $4k$ to get $l = 5 - 9k$.\n\nThe distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The distance from $A$ to the origin is $\\sqrt{x_1^2 + (k x_1^2 - 2k x_1 + l)^2}$, and similarly for $B$. We want to find $d_A^2 + d_B^2$, where $d_A$ and $d_B$ are the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, respectively.\n\nUsing the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nd_A^2 + d_B^2 &= \\left(x_1^2 + (k x_1^2 - 2k x_1 + l)^2\\right) + \\left(x_2^2 + (k x_2^2 - 2k x_2 + l)^2\\right) \\\\\n&= \\left(1 + \\left(k - 2k + 5 - 9k\\right)^2\\right) + \\left(9 + \\left(9k - 18k + 5 - 9k\\right)^2\\right) \\\\\n&= \\left(1 + (5 - 10k)^2\\right) + \\left(9 + (5 - 9k)^2\\right) \\\\\n&= 1 + 25 - 100k + 100k^2 + 81 + 25 - 90k + 81k^2 \\\\\n&= 106 + 181k^2 - 110k.\n\\end{align*}\nTo find the value of this expression, we need to find the values of $k$ and $l$. From $l = 5 - 9k$, we can substitute $l$ into the equation $36k^2 = 20k - 4kl$ to get\n\\[36k^2 = 20k - 4k(5 - 9k),\\]\nwhich simplifies to $36k^2 = 20k - 20k + 36k^2$, or $0 = 0$. This means that our value of $l$ is correct, and we can substitute $l = 5 - 9k$ into $d_A^2 + d_B^2 = 106 + 181k^2 - 110k$ to get\n\\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = 106 + 181k^2 - 110k.\\]\nTo find the value of this expression for a specific value of $k$, we can substitute that value into the expression and calculate the result. However, this problem does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the value of $k$, so we cannot find the exact value of $d_A^2 + d_B^2$. Nevertheless, the expression $106 + 181k^2 - 110k$ gives a general formula for the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin in terms of $k$.\nThe answer is: $106 + 181k^2 - 110k$.\nRole:\nYou are an advanced AI system with exceptional mathematical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, specifically designed to solve tricky math problems (whose answer is a non-negative integer) written in LaTeX format from the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) competition.

What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be?\n\nSolution: Let's denote the number of yellow numbers as $y$ and the number of blue numbers as $b$. Since each of the three-digit numbers from 111 to 999 is colored either blue or yellow, we have $y + b = 999 - 111 + 1 = 899$.\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum number of blue numbers. The smallest possible blue number is 111 and the largest possible yellow number is 999. If we choose the blue number as 111, then for any yellow number $y$, the sum $y + 111$ must be a blue number. The largest possible yellow number is 999, so the smallest possible blue number when $y = 999$ is $999 + 111 - 999 = 111$. This means that all the numbers from 111 to 999 are blue, so there are no yellow numbers, which is a contradiction because we are asked to find the maximum number of yellow numbers.\n\nHence, we need to find the maximum number of yellow numbers while still having at least one blue number. The key observation is that for any two yellow numbers $y_1$ and $y_2$, the sum $y_1 + y_2$ must be a blue number. This means that the sum of any pair of yellow numbers must have the form $111 + k$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer.\n\nLet's start by setting $y_1 = 111$. Then, for any yellow number $y_2$, the sum $y_1 + y_2 = 111 + y_2$ must be a blue number. The largest possible value of $y_2$ is 999, so $111 + y_2 = 999$, which gives $y_2 = 888$. Therefore, we have found one yellow number, $111$, and one blue number, $999$.\n\nNow, let's consider adding another yellow number $y_3$. The sum $y_1 + y_3 = 111 + y_3$ must be a blue number, which means $111 + y_3 = 999 + k$ for some non-negative integer $k$. Simplifying this equation gives $y_3 = 888 + k$. Since $y_3$ must be a yellow number, it must be less than or equal to 999. The largest possible value of $k$ is when $y_3 = 999$, so $999 = 888 + k$, which gives $k = 111$. Therefore, we can add another yellow number $y_3 = 999 - 111 = 888$.\n\nAdding another yellow number $y_4$ would result in a sum $y_1 + y_4 = 111 + y_4$ that is larger than 999, so we cannot add any more yellow numbers without violating the conditions of the problem.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of yellow numbers is 2, with the yellow numbers being 111 and 888. The number of blue numbers is 897 (since $y + b = 899$ and $y = 2$).\n\nThe maximum number of yellow numbers is 2.\nThe answer is: 2\nRole:\nYou are an advanced AI system with exceptional mathematical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, specifically designed to solve tricky math problems (whose answer is a non-negative integer) written in LaTeX format from the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) competition.

A robot starts with a positive integer on a blackboard, then after each second for the rest of eternity, replaces the number on the board with its sparkle. For some `special' numbers, if they're the first number, then eventually every number that appears will be less than 6. How many such special numbers are there with at most 36 digits?\n\nSolution: First, let's consider the numbers less than 6. The only possible numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. If the number is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, after one application of the `sparkle' operation, we get 1, 2, 6, 24, or 120 respectively. All of these are less than 6.\n\nNow, let's consider a number greater than 5 but less than 6. If the number is 6, after one application of the `sparkle' operation, we get $6! = 720$. Since 720 is greater than 5, we need to check the sparkle of 720. The sparkle of 720 is $7+2+0 = 9$, and $9! = 362880$. This is too large to be considered.\n\nTherefore, the only special numbers with at most 36 digits are those less than or equal to 5. There are 5 such numbers.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{5}$.\nRole:\nYou are an advanced AI system with exceptional mathematical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, specifically designed to solve tricky math problems (whose answer is a non-negative integer) written in LaTeX format from the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) competition.

This implies that $x-2y = y-2x$ or $x-2y = -(y-2x)$.\nSolving the first equation $x-2y = y-2x$, we get $3x = 3y$, so $x=y$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation $x-2y = -(y-2x)$, we get $x-2x = -y+2y$, which simplifies to $-x = y$.\nSo, $x=y=-x$, which implies $x=y=0$.\nNow, we substitute $x=y=0$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(0)^2+5(0)^2-8(0)(0) = 0$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.\nThe answer is: $0$\nRole:\nYou are an advanced AI system with exceptional mathematical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, specifically designed to solve tricky math problems (whose answer is a non-negative integer) written in LaTeX format from the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) competition.

What is their sum?\n\nSolution: Let the five terms of the geometric sequence be $a,$ $ar,$ $ar^2,$ $ar^3,$ $ar^4,$ where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio. Since we are looking for 2-digit positive integers, $a$ must be a 2-digit positive integer and $r$ must be a positive integer because the sequence is increasing.\n\nSince the sequence is increasing, $r > 1$. To find the minimum value of $a$, we want $r$ to be as small as possible. The smallest integer $r$ can be is $2$, because if we choose $r = 1$, the sequence would be just five identical 2-digit numbers, which is not what we want.\n\nSo, the minimum value of $a$ is the smallest 2-digit number, which is $10$. With $a = 10$ and $r = 2$, the sequence becomes $10,$ $20,$ $40,$ $80,$ $160$. However, $160$ is not a 2-digit number, so we need to increase $a$.\n\nIf we try $a = 11,$ the sequence becomes $11,$ $22,$ $44,$ $88,$ $176,$ and $176$ is still not a 2-digit number. We can keep increasing $a$ until we find a value that works. When we try $a = 12$, the sequence becomes $12,$ $24,$ $48,$ $96,$ $192,$ and $192$ is a 2-digit number. So, the sequence is $12,$ $24,$ $48,$ $96,$ $192$. This sequence satisfies all the conditions: it is an increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers.\n\nTo find the sum of the sequence, we simply add up the five terms: $12 + 24 + 48 + 96 + 192 = 372$. So, the sum of the sequence is $372$.\nThe answer is: 372.\nRole:\nYou are an advanced AI system with exceptional mathematical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, specifically designed to solve tricky math problems (whose answer is a non-negative integer) written in LaTeX format from the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) competition.

The equation has the form $|\\vert x-1 \\vert -2|=\\frac{m}{100}$. The number of solutions depends on the value of $m$. We want to find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.\n\nWe can start by considering the inner absolute value expression $\\vert x-1 \\vert -2$. This expression can take on three different forms depending on the value of $x$:\n\n1. If $x < 1$, we have $\\vert x-1 \\vert -2 = -(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1$.\n2. If $1 \\leq x \\leq 3$, we have $\\vert x-1 \\vert -2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.\n3. If $x > 3$, we have $\\vert x-1 \\vert -2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.\n\nSo, the equation $|\\vert x-1 \\vert -2|=\\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as:\n\n1. If $x < 1$, we have $\\vert -x - 1 \\vert = \\frac{m}{100}$, or $\\vert x + 1 \\vert = \\frac{m}{100}$.\n2. If $1 \\leq x \\leq 3$, we have $\\vert x - 3 \\vert = \\frac{m}{100}$.\n3. If $x > 3$, we have $\\vert x - 3 \\vert = \\frac{m}{100}$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the number of solutions for each case:\n\n1. If $x < 1$, the equation $\\vert x + 1 \\vert = \\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions if $\\frac{m}{100} > 1$, or $m > 100$.\n2. If $1 \\leq x \\leq 3$, the equation $\\vert x - 3 \\vert = \\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions if $0 < \\frac{m}{100} \\leq 2$, or $0 < m \\leq 200$.\n3. If $x > 3$, the equation $\\vert x - 3 \\vert = \\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions if $\\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 200$.\n\nSo, the equation $|\\vert x-1 \\vert -2|=\\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $0 < m \\leq 200$. Therefore, there are $200$ positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

For $f(x, y) = 0$, either $(\\vert x + y \\vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\\vert x - y \\vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\\vert x \\vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\\vert y \\vert - 8)^2 = 0$.\n\nIf $(\\vert x + y \\vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\\vert x + y \\vert = 10$, so $x + y = \\pm 10$.\nIf $(\\vert x - y \\vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\\vert x - y \\vert = 10$, so $x - y = \\pm 10$.\nIf $(\\vert x \\vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\\vert x \\vert = 8$, so $x = \\pm 8$.\nIf $(\\vert y \\vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\\vert y \\vert = 8$, so $y = \\pm 8$.\n\nThe solutions to these equations are:\n$x + y = \\pm 10$: The lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.\n$x - y = \\pm 10$: The lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.\n$x = \\pm 8$: The lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.\n$y = \\pm 8$: The lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.\n\nThe points where these lines intersect are the vertices of the polygon.

Let $P$ be the point on $AB$ such that $|AP| = 1/{20}$ and let $Q$ be the point on $AD$ such that $|AQ| = 1/{24}$. The lines $DP$ and $BQ$ divide the square into four regions. Find the ratio between the areas of the largest region and the smallest region.\n\nSolution: First, let's find the areas of the four regions.\nThe area of the entire square is 1.\nThe area of triangle $ABQ$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{24} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{48}$.\nThe area of triangle $DPC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{20} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{40}$.\nThe area of the quadrilateral $BPDQ$ is the area of the square minus the sum of the areas of the two triangles, which is $1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{48} + \\frac{1}{40}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{48 + 40}{48 \\cdot 40} = 1 - \\frac{88}{24 \\cdot 40} = 1 - \\frac{11}{240} = \\frac{240 - 11}{240} = \\frac{229}{240}$.\nThe area of the smallest region (the triangle with vertices at $P$, $Q$, and the origin) is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{20} \\cdot \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{1}{480}$.\nThe ratio of the area of the largest region ($BPDQ$) to the smallest region ($PQT$) is $\\frac{\\frac{229}{240}}{\\frac{1}{480}} = \\frac{229 \\cdot 480}{240} = 229 \\cdot 2 = 458$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the areas of the largest region and the smallest region is 458.\nThe answer is: $458$\nRole:\nYou are an advanced AI system with exceptional mathematical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, specifically designed to solve tricky math problems (whose answer is a non-negative integer) written in LaTeX format from the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) competition.
