What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be?\n","\n","Solution: Let's denote the number of yellow numbers as $y$ and the number of blue numbers as $b$. Since each of the three-digit numbers from 111 to 999 is colored either blue or yellow, we have $y + b = 999 - 111 + 1 = 899$.\n","\n","Now, let's consider the minimum number of blue numbers. The smallest possible blue number is 111 and the largest possible yellow number is 999. If we choose the blue number as 111, then for any yellow number $y$, the sum $y + 111$ must be a blue number. The largest possible yellow number is 999, so the smallest possible blue number when $y = 999$ is $999 + 111 - 999 = 111$. This means that all the numbers from 111 to 999 are blue, so there are no yellow numbers, which is a contradiction because we are asked to find the maximum number of yellow numbers.\n","\n","Hence, we need to find the maximum number of yellow numbers while still having at least one blue number. The key observation is that for any two yellow numbers $y_1$ and $y_2$, the sum $y_1 + y_2$ must be a blue number. This means that the sum of any pair of yellow numbers must have the form $111 + k$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer.\n","\n","Let's start by setting $y_1 = 111$. Then, for any yellow number $y_2$, the sum $y_1 + y_2 = 111 + y_2$ must be a blue number. The largest possible value of $y_2$ is 999, so $111 + y_2 = 999$, which gives $y_2 = 888$. Therefore, we have found one yellow number, $111$, and one blue number, $999$.\n","\n","Now, let's consider adding another yellow number $y_3$. The sum $y_1 + y_3 = 111 + y_3$ must be a blue number, which means $111 + y_3 = 999 + k$ for some non-negative integer $k$. Simplifying this equation gives $y_3 = 888 + k$. Since $y_3$ must be a yellow number, it must be less than or equal to 999. The largest possible value of $k$ is when $y_3 = 999$, so $999 = 888 + k$, which gives $k = 111$. Therefore, we can add another yellow number $y_3 = 999 - 111 = 888$.\n","\n","Adding another yellow number $y_4$ would result in a sum $y_1 + y_4 = 111 + y_4$ that is larger than 999, so we cannot add any more yellow numbers without violating the conditions of the problem.\n","\n","Therefore, the maximum number of yellow numbers is 2, with the yellow numbers being 111 and 888. The number of blue numbers is 897 (since $y + b = 899$ and $y = 2$).\n","\n","The maximum number of yellow numbers is 2.\n","The answer is: 2\n","Role:\n","You are an advanced AI system with exceptional mathematical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, specifically designed to solve tricky math problems (whose answer is a non-negative integer) written in LaTeX format from the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) competition.

For some `special' numbers, if they're the first number, then eventually every number that appears will be less than 6.

If the number is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, after one application of the `sparkle' operation, we get 1, 2, 6, 24, or 120 respectively.

What is their sum?\n","\n","Solution: Let the five terms of the geometric sequence be $a,$ $ar,$ $ar^2,$ $ar^3,$ $ar^4,$ where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio. Since we are looking for 2-digit positive integers, $a$ must be a 2-digit positive integer and $r$ must be a positive integer because the sequence is increasing.\n","\n","Since the sequence is increasing, $r > 1$. To find the minimum value of $a$, we want $r$ to be as small as possible. The smallest integer $r$ can be is $2$, because if we choose $r = 1$, the sequence would be just five identical 2-digit numbers, which is not what we want.\n","\n","So, the minimum value of $a$ is the smallest 2-digit number, which is $10$. With $a = 10$ and $r = 2$, the sequence becomes $10,$ $20,$ $40,$ $80,$ $160$. However, $160$ is not a 2-digit number, so we need to increase $a$.\n","\n","If we try $a = 11,$ the sequence becomes $11,$ $22,$ $44,$ $88,$ $176,$ and $176$ is still not a 2-digit number. We can keep increasing $a$ until we find a value that works. When we try $a = 12$, the sequence becomes $12,$ $24,$ $48,$ $96,$ $192,$ and $192$ is a 2-digit number. So, the sequence is $12,$ $24,$ $48,$ $96,$ $192$. This sequence satisfies all the conditions: it is an increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers.\n","\n","To find the sum of the sequence, we simply add up the five terms: $12 + 24 + 48 + 96 + 192 = 372$.
